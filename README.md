_Athaya Zahrani Irmansyah as a Purwadhika JCDS-0408 Student On Site Bandung 2024 / Capstone Project Module 2 Data Analysis with Case Study NEW YORK CITY TAXIS AND LIMOUSINES COMMISSION (NYC TLC) TRIP RECORD (in Bahasa)_

*`New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC)`* is a commission under the government of New York City in the United States, covering the vehicle rental industry, regulating, and facilitating taxis/limousines for city residents or tourists in New York City.

NYC TLC is a large part of the city's transportation system with high and fluctuating demand for shuttle services throughout the day. Effectively managing shuttle operations is a significant challenge for both the government and stakeholders, particularly in optimizing pick-up times and locations.

With technological advancements and increased data availability, analyzing historical taxi trip data has become essential. The benefits of analyzing historical taxi trip data include:
-	Optimizing routes and pick-ups
-	Predicting shuttle demand
-	Improving customer satisfaction
-	Better fleet management
-	Developing policies, infrastructure, and product development
-	Enhancing security detection

The trip data recorded by NYC TLC and its associated vendors include detailed information about pick-up and drop-off times and locations. By applying Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to this data, the goal is to explore passenger demand patterns and understand operational dynamics more deeply.

In the taxi industry, understanding customer demand patterns, regional preferences, and factors influencing customer satisfaction (e.g., tips) is key to optimizing operations and improving profitability. By assessing when and where services are most needed, and what drives customers to provide additional appreciation, companies can make more informed decisions regarding fleet scheduling, pricing strategies, and marketing initiatives.

Comprehensive data analysis is necessary to identify patterns and trends in customer demand, regional preferences, and customer satisfaction. This data may include information on pick-up times and locations, trip distances, trip durations, fares, payment methods, and tips.

Using data analysis techniques such as data visualization, descriptive statistics, and inferential statistics, it is expected that the company can gain valuable insights into customer behavior and preferences. These insights can be used to develop more effective strategies to meet customer needs and enhance customer satisfaction.
